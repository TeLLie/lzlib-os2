Changes in version 1.14:

In minilzip, file diagnostics have been reformatted as 'PROGRAM: FILE: MESSAGE'.

In minilzip, diagnostics caused by invalid arguments to command-line options
now show the argument and the name of the option.

The option '-o, --output' of minilzip now preserves dates, permissions, and
ownership of the file, when (de)compressing exactly one file.

It has been documented in the manual that it is the responsibility of the
program using lzlib to include before 'lzlib.h' some header that declares
the type 'uint8_t'. (Reported by Michal Górny).

The variable MAKEINFO has been added to configure and Makefile.in.

It has been documented in INSTALL that when choosing a C standard, the POSIX
features need to be enabled explicitly:
  ./configure CFLAGS+='--std=c99 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500'
