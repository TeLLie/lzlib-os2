Changes in version 1.11:

In case of decompression error caused by corrupt or truncated data,
LZ_decompress_read now does not signal the error immediately to the
application, but waits until all decoded bytes have been read. This
allows tools like tarlz to recover as much data as possible from damaged
members.

It is now an error to specify two different operations to minilzip in
the command line (--decompress and --test).

Minilzip now also checks for errors when closing the input file.

Minilzip now compiles on DOS with DJGPP. (Patch from Robert Riebisch).

The descriptions of '-0..-9', '-m' and '-s' in the manual have been
improved.

It has been documented that it is safe to call 'LZ_(de)compress_finish'
as many times as needed. Examples in the manual have been simplified.

The configure script now accepts appending options to CFLAGS using the
syntax 'CFLAGS+=OPTIONS'.

Makefile targets 'install-bin*' have been renamed to 'install-lib*'. New
'install-bin*' targets have been created that install a shared minilzip,
or a static minilzip if the shared library has not been configured.

It has been documented in INSTALL the use of
CFLAGS+='-D __USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO' when compiling on MinGW.
